Divergent Aptitude Test
=======================

This is the test from the Divergent book. See what faction you would be in! :)

This is just a regular Python file, download Python here: https://www.python.org/ and get the 3.4 version. Then install it (I suggest you check the box that adds it to the PATH), and then run the .py file.
